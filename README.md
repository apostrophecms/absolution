`absolution` accepts HTML and a base URL, and returns HTML with absolute URLs. Great for generating valid RSS feeds.

`absolution` is not too picky about your HTML.

## Requirements

`absolution` is intended for use with Node. That's pretty much it. All of its npm dependencies are pure JavaScript. `absolution` is built on the excellent `htmlparser2` module.

## How to use

`npm install absolution`

```javascript
var absolution = require('absolution');

var dirty = '<a href="/foo">Foo!</a>';
var clean = absolution(dirty, 'http://example.com');

// clean is now:
// <a href="http://example.com/foo">Foo!</a>
```

Boom!

If you want to do further processing of each absolute URL, you can also pass a decorator function:

```javascript
var clean = absolution(dirty, 'http://example.com', {
  decorator: function(url) {
    return 'http://mycoolthing.com?url=' + encodeURIComponent(url);
  }
});
```

## Changelog

1.0.2: Updates to lodash v4 for a security vulnerability fix.

1.0.0: no new changes; declared stable as with the addition of the decorator option there's little left to do, and all tests are passing nicely.

0.2.0: decorator option added.

0.1.0: initial release.
